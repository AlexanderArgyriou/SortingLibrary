# SortingLibrary
* A mini sorting “library”, C++ approach, using the fastest sorting algorithms compared by sorting speed, in both parallel and serial “enviroments”.
* Still trying to make a parallel run with all algorithms active on different arrays with openMP instead of thread class.
* Main() driver demo can walk you through all the limit tests.
